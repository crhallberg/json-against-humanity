A child's love of sticks.
A man two times the size of a man half his size.
Abandoning all concepts and categories and seeing the world as it truly is.
Abort-tron, the abortion robot.
Achieving total fitness and turning into a mental cube.
Being blind but having super strength but having Alzheimer's Disease by being invisible.
Collapsing into singularity. Twenty minutes fo foreplay, three minutes of coitus, five minutes of rest, back to the yards for some croquet.
Computers.
Cum, but it's ranch.
"Fashion...heard of it?"
Getting my mind boggled by a gang of mind bogglers.
Letting these hoes know.
"Meatballs, meatballs, meatballs!"
Passing fart and making toilet.
Running afoul of the Sultan's Janissaries.
Sheboygan, Wisconsin.
Struggling to swallow a live bat.
Taking off my glasses and becoming beautiful.
The tiny man who lives inside the ATM and hands out all the money.
The tiny man who only eats coffee beans and diarrheas into my thermos every morning.
Using electric eels to solve the world's energy crisis.
Why, a hot air balloon of course!
"You there! French boy!"

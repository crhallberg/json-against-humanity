Holding up the line at Walgreens by trying to use an expired coupon.
Whoopi Goldberg.
Wandering the desert for 40 years.
Some kind of concentrated encampment for people.
Hiding from the Nazis.
Suddenly remembering that the Holocaust happened.
Chopping off a bit of the penis.
Bags of money.
A little bit of schmutz right there.
Demolishing that ass like a Palestinian village.
A lifetime of internalized guilt.
A headache that's definitely cancer.
What it means to be a Jewish woman in contemporary society.

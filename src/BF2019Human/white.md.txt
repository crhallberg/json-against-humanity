The salmon.
Really tall people.
Getting my butt trapped hilariously in a tuba.
How good this cantaloupe feels on my penis.
Using words to communicate.
Forming a monogamous pairbond.
Getting sad for no reason.
Harnessing the power of steam!!!
The unspeakable horrors of factory farming.
Being terrified of a single bee.
Unwelcome sexual attention from grown men.
A pointless job at a soulless corporation.
Just hangin' out, ya know?
Being young and in love in New York City.
Chemotherapy.
Watching the life drain from the eyes of my son's killer.
Saying "What's that?" and then stealing a french fry.
Three hours of pimple-popping videos.
This horrble thing called Twitter.
Good ol' fashioned face-to-face conversation.
War with China.
The whole Jeffrey Epstein thing.
The joy of song.
Sucking all the oil out of the planet and fucking off to Mars.
Losing a loved one to Fox News.
The bomb strapped to my chest.
Like 50 mosquito bites.
Delighting in the pain of others.

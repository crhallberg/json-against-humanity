A choir of angels descending from the sky and jizzing all over dad's sweater.
A frozen homeless man shattering on your doorstep.
How cool it is that I love Jesus and he loves me back.
How great of a blowjob Jesus could give.
How many drinks Aunty Deborah has had.
A snowman that contains the soul of my dead father.
My uncle who voted for Trump.
Probably Grandma's last Christmas, kids.
Snow falling gently on the frozen body of an orphan boy.
Starting to see where ISIS is coming from.

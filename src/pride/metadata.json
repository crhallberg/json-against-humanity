    "description": "Itâ€™s Pride Month, the time of year when companies put a rainbow on their products to capitalize on gay culture. Fabulous! 30 cards that completely encapsulate the queer experience. Written by an elite squad of lesbians, bisexuals, gays, trans people, allies, and unicorns. All profits donated to Howard Brown Health."

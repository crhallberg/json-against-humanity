Lou Gehrig's Disease.
Mexicans and Muslims.
My drunk father screaming from the bleachers.
Our dumb asshole president.
Slowly shaking my head at a sad statistic.
Speaking in iambic pentameter.
Taking a minute to really unpack what Shakespeare is getting at in this scene.
Teaching my son to love the Red Sox and hate minorities.
The shocking stupidity of the American public.
The significance of eyes in King Lear.
The truth.
Two baby otters holding hands.
Two hamsters nibbling on a tiny burrito.
White people becoming a minority.
Yelling "I got it, I got it!"

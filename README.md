## [CAHDeck.js](./web/CAHDeck.js)

I've written a simple JS library to make working with the compact file format easier. [Customize and download a compact deck](https://crhallberg.com/cah/) and load it into JS with it like so.

```js
// Load a deck downloaded from the website
const deck = Deck.fromFile("../cah-all-compact.json");

// List your packs
const packSummaries = deck.listPacks();
/**
 * [
 *   {
 *     id: 0,
 *     icon: "seagull",
 *     name: "CAH Base Set",
 *     official: true,
 *     counts: {
 *       white: 420,
 *       black: 39,
 *     },
 *   },
 *   ...
 * ]
 */

// Get your packs
const base = deck.getPackByName("CAH Base Set");
// or
const base = deck.getPackById(0);
// or

// Use your packs!
base.white[0] // { text: "Teaching a robot to love.", packID: 0, icon: "seagull" }
base.black[0] // { text: "What's that sound?", pick: 1, packID: 0, icon: "seagull" }
```
